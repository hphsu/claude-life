### Phase 2: Dyadic Compatibility Assessment

#### 1. Attachment Compatibility Matrix

| Partner A → / Partner B ↓ | Secure | Anxious | Dismissive | Fearful |
|---------------------------|--------|---------|------------|---------|
| **Secure**                | 100    | 85      | 80         | 70      |
| **Anxious**               | 85     | 60      | 40         | 50      |
| **Dismissive**            | 80     | 40      | 65         | 55      |
| **Fearful**               | 70     | 50      | 55         | 45      |

**Scoring Logic**:
- **Secure-Secure (100)**: Optimal pairing, mutual trust and balance
- **Secure + Any (70-85)**: Secure partner can often accommodate other styles
- **Anxious-Dismissive (40)**: Classic "pursuer-distancer" trap, high conflict potential
- **Anxious-Anxious (60)**: High emotional intensity, can work with awareness
- **Avoidant-Avoidant (65)**: Low conflict but may lack emotional depth

**Modifier Factors**:
- **Self-awareness (+10)**: If both partners understand their attachment patterns
- **Therapy engagement (+10)**: If actively working on attachment security
- **Trauma history (-15)**: Unresolved relational trauma reduces compatibility
- **Growth mindset (+5)**: Willingness to develop more secure attachment

#### 2. Communication Compatibility

**Direct-Direct**: 90 points (high clarity, efficient resolution)
**Direct-Assertive**: 95 points (optimal combination)
**Indirect-Indirect**: 80 points (mutual understanding, potential for ambiguity)
**Assertive-Assertive**: 100 points (gold standard, mutual respect)
**Direct-Indirect**: 55 points (high misunderstanding risk, needs bridging work)
**Passive-Aggressive + Any**: 40 points (requires individual therapy first)

**Cross-Cultural Communication (+)**:
- Both partners culturally competent: +15 points
- One partner adapts communication style: +10 points
- Explicit meta-communication practices: +10 points
- Language barriers without mitigation: -20 points

**Conflict Communication Patterns** (Gottman Four Horsemen Assessment):
- **Criticism** (人身攻擊): Present = -10 points per pattern
- **Contempt** (輕蔑): Present = -15 points (most toxic predictor)
- **Defensiveness** (防衛): Present = -10 points
- **Stonewalling** (冷戰): Present = -12 points

**Positive Interaction Ratio**:
- 5:1 or higher (positive:negative): 100 points
- 3:1 to 5:1: 80 points
- 1:1 to 3:1: 60 points
- Below 1:1: 40 points (relationship distress)

#### 3. Emotional Intelligence Compatibility

**Method**: Calculate both individual EQ scores, then assess compatibility

```python
def calculate_eq_compatibility(eq_A, eq_B):
    """Calculate EQ compatibility score (0-100)"""
    avg_eq = (eq_A + eq_B) / 2
    eq_difference = abs(eq_A - eq_B)

    # Base score from average EQ
    base_score = avg_eq

    # Penalty for large EQ gaps (asymmetry can cause issues)
    if eq_difference > 30:
        penalty = 15
    elif eq_difference > 20:
        penalty = 10
    elif eq_difference > 10:
        penalty = 5
    else:
        penalty = 0

    # Bonus for both high EQ
    if eq_A > 75 and eq_B > 75:
        bonus = 10
    else:
        bonus = 0

    return min(100, base_score - penalty + bonus)
```

**EQ Compatibility Scoring**:
- Both high EQ (>75): 90-100 points (excellent emotional attunement)
- Both moderate EQ (50-75): 70-85 points (functional with growth potential)
- One high, one moderate: 65-80 points (high EQ partner may compensate)
- One high, one low: 50-65 points (imbalance creates frustration)
- Both low EQ (<50): 40-55 points (high conflict, low repair capacity)

#### 4. Values Alignment Assessment

**Calculate Total Values Score**: Sum all 6 value domain alignment scores (max 100)

**Overall Values Compatibility**:
- 85-100: Exceptional alignment (同步)
- 70-84: Strong alignment (契合)
- 55-69: Moderate alignment (需調和)
- 40-54: Significant differences (需大量溝通)
- <40: Fundamental incompatibility (核心衝突)

**Critical Values (Non-Negotiables)**:
- Children (want vs. don't want): If misaligned, reduce total compatibility by 20%
- Major religious differences: If source of conflict, -15 points

- Respect for each other's intelligence
- Mental engagement level
- Score: 0-20 points

**Long-Term Sustainability** (長期維持):
- Intimacy maintenance behaviors
- Novelty and growth orientation
- Effort investment (Gottman's "Bids for Connection")
- Adaptation to life stages
- Score: 0-25 points

**Total Intimacy Score**: 0-100 points

**Sternberg's Triangular Theory Application**:
```
Intimacy + Passion + Commitment = Consummate Love (圓滿之愛)

Relationship Types:
- Intimacy only: Liking (友情)
- Passion only: Infatuation (迷戀)
- Commitment only: Empty Love (空洞之愛)
- Intimacy + Passion: Romantic Love (浪漫之愛)
- Intimacy + Commitment: Companionate Love (伴侶之愛)
- Passion + Commitment: Fatuous Love (愚昧之愛)
- All three: Consummate Love (理想目標)
```

#### 6. Friendship & Liking Foundation

**Genuine Liking** (純粹喜歡):

3. **Emotional Intelligence**: From EQ compatibility calculation
4. **Values Alignment**: From values assessment
5. **Passion & Intimacy**: From intimacy assessment

#### Weighted Overall Score

```python
def calculate_overall_compatibility(scores):
    """
    Calculate weighted overall compatibility

    scores = {
        'attachment': 0-100,
        'communication': 0-100,
        'emotional_intelligence': 0-100,
        'values': 0-100,
        'intimacy': 0-100,
        'friendship': 0-100
    }
    """

    # Base weights
    weights = {
        'attachment': 0.20,      # Foundation of relationship security
        'communication': 0.20,   # Critical for daily functioning
        'emotional_intelligence': 0.15,  # Conflict resolution capacity
        'values': 0.20,          # Long-term alignment
        'intimacy': 0.15,        # Connection and passion
        'friendship': 0.10       # Enjoyment and liking
    }

    # Calculate weighted score
    total = sum(scores[dim] * weights[dim] for dim in scores)

    # Apply relationship stage modifier
    # Early relationships: intimacy weighted higher
    # Long-term relationships: friendship and values weighted higher

    return round(total, 1)
```

**Overall Compatibility Grade**:
- **90-100**: Exceptional Compatibility (極佳配對)
  - All dimensions strong, rare and valuable pairing
  - Minimal therapeutic intervention needed
  - High probability of long-term satisfaction

- **80-89**: Strong Compatibility (良好配對)
  - Most dimensions strong with minor growth areas
  - Relationship skills coaching beneficial
  - Very good long-term prospects with effort

- **70-79**: Good Compatibility (可行配對)
  - Solid foundation with some notable challenges
  - Couples therapy recommended for specific issues
  - Moderate effort required for success

- **60-69**: Moderate Compatibility (需大量投入)
  - Significant challenges in one or more key areas
  - Intensive couples therapy strongly recommended
  - High effort required, uncertain long-term prospects

- **50-59**: Challenging Compatibility (高度挑戰)
  - Multiple significant incompatibilities
  - Professional therapeutic support essential
  - Consider whether relationship is viable long-term

- **<50**: Fundamental Incompatibility (不建議繼續)
  - Core incompatibilities across multiple domains
  - Relationship likely unsustainable without major changes
  - Recommend honest evaluation of relationship viability

### Phase 4: Integration with Traditional Frameworks

**How Psychological Assessment Complements Traditional Methods:**

#### BaZi (八字) Integration:
- **BaZi reveals**: Karmic patterns, elemental compatibility, destiny timing
- **Psychology adds**: Conscious coping strategies, attachment security development
- **Synergy**: BaZi shows "what is likely to happen"; psychology shows "how to work with it"
- **Example**: BaZi shows controlling element relationship → Psychology suggests communication strategies to balance power dynamics

#### Zi Wei (紫微) Integration:
- **Zi Wei reveals**: Life structure, relationship phases, palace dynamics
- **Psychology adds**: Emotional awareness, conflict resolution skills for each phase
- **Synergy**: Zi Wei maps "when challenges arise"; psychology provides "tools to navigate them"
- **Example**: Zi Wei indicates challenging period → Psychology recommends preventive couples check-ins

#### Western Synastry Integration:
- **Synastry reveals**: Astrological aspects, planetary energies, attraction patterns
- **Psychology adds**: Concrete behavioral strategies, attachment-informed approaches
- **Synergy**: Synastry identifies "emotional dynamics"; psychology teaches "how to communicate through them"
- **Example**: Moon square suggests emotional friction → Psychology offers emotion regulation techniques

**Cross-Framework Synthesis Pattern**:
```
Traditional Methods → Identify Patterns & Predictions
         ↓
Psychological Framework → Provides Agency & Tools
         ↓
Combined Insight → "This is your pattern (destiny/structure/energy)
                    AND here's how to work with it consciously"
```

**When Psychology Takes the Lead**:
- Attachment wounding from childhood → Therapy needed regardless of traditional indicators
- Active addiction or mental health crisis → Clinical intervention before compatibility assessment
- Abuse or safety concerns → Immediate psychological/safety intervention supersedes all methods
- Communication breakdown → Teach skills before assessing "destiny compatibility"

**When Psychology Defers to Traditional Methods**:
- Deep karmic patterns better explained by BaZi
- Timing of relationship phases more precise in Zi Wei
- Energetic attraction dynamics clearer in Synastry
- Long-term destiny questions beyond psychology's scope

### Phase 5: Recommendations & Growth Path

#### Short-Term Actions (0-6 months)

**For Secure-Secure Pairings**:
- Maintain positive interaction ratio (5:1)
- Establish shared rituals and routines
- Continue vulnerability and emotional sharing
- Celebrate relationship strengths

- Consider attachment-focused couples therapy

**For Low EQ Pairings**:
